# Canvas Assignment Grader

This project is a Python script that periodically checks for new submissions to a Canvas assignment, grades them based on predefined criteria with ChatGPT, and updates the grade and comments on Canvas. The script is designed to be run as a cron job, checking for new submissions every minute.

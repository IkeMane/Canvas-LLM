Strategically Selecting Work & Activities: Your goal is to grade this assignment submissions.


Guidelines

The AMCAS Activities List provides room for 15 entries, including three designated for your Most Meaningful Experiences. As you contemplate which 15 activities to include, it's important to ensure a balanced distribution across the AMCAS categories. Medical schools often employ a scoring rubric based on these categories, so structuring your activities to demonstrate a well-rounded experience can be advantageous. The first step in this process is to thoroughly review and complete this document independently. 
Only list undergraduate or graduate experiences. Do not include activities from high school unless you continued those experiences in college. 
Use categorization to your advantage. If you have more than 15 activities or less than 15, refer to this guide for instructions detailing when to combine vs. when to split activities. 
Use a maximum of 60 characters for each experience name, just as you will in the actual AMCAS application. Utilize this guide to confirm that you have appropriately filled out the fields (experience name, hours completed, organization name) below.

Applicants, highlight this statement to confirm you read the instructions above.

Note to Applicants:

For "Completed Hours," calculate all of the following:

(A) The total number of hours you have dedicated to performing your specific duties, starting from the beginning of your role until the present day. For example, if you are a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA), indicate the cumulative hours spent in direct patient care.

(B) The number of hours you expect to spend on this activity from today until June 1, 2024.

(C) The number of hours you spent on training. For instance, if you had to take an 8-week long training course, how many hours did you spend on that course? Be sure to count time spent studying outside the course.

(D) The number of hours you spent applying and interviewing for that position. For instance, if you had to undergo three rounds of interviews, each 1.5 hours long, count that time.

(E) The number of hours you spent doing anything for this position--commuting, reading a manual, signing a contract, orientation, company meetings--that you would not have done during your free time. Don't double-dip hours from (A), (B), (C), or (D)--but don't sell yourself short, either. Most applicants significantly underestimate the Completed Hours for their activity.

Then, add (A) + (B) + (C) + (D) + (E). Write down this sum.

If this sum is greater than 100, record this in "Completed Hours."

If the total number of hours dedicated to a specific activity is under 100, you will need to combine these hours with those from a related activity, as detailed in the 'When to Combine Activities' section of this guide. For example, if you have 59 hours of experience working as a Patient Sitter and 450 hours as a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA), you could report a combined total of 509 hours under the CNA category, considering the similarities in job responsibilities between the two roles. Admissions committees often regard 100 hours as a minimum threshold for evaluating an applicant’s sustained commitment to an activity. Their thought process is: if an applicant spent fewer than 100 hours on this activity, was it really that meaningful in their journey to medicine?

FAQ: “But won't medical schools call to verify my activity hours? I'm not sure my contact would agree that I've worked XYZ number of hours.”

Answer: Keep in mind that the hours your employer officially records aren't the only ones you should count. When filling out this part of the application, don't underestimate your total time commitment. In the unlikely event this issue arises, 

For “Anticipated Hours,” ask yourself the following question: Approximately how many hours will I spend on this activity from June 1, 2024 to August 31, 2025? 

Then, record this number for “Anticipated Hours.”

Summary of AMCAS Classifications


Note: If you are using AACOMAS or TMDSAS, skip this section.

If you are using AMCAS, it’s helpful to keep track of the number of activities in each AMCAS category (e.g., Research/Lab; Teaching/Tutoring/Teaching Assistant). This ensures that you present a well-rounded application. Many activities could theoretically be classified as more than one category on AMCAS; your goal for this section is to strategically categorize your activities in a way that best highlights the breadth of your experiences--to balance your application by not overloading any single category.

Keep in mind that you should aim to have at least one AMCAS entry on your application for the following categories:
Research/Lab
Physician Shadowing/Clinical Observation
Leadership - Not Listed Elsewhere
Community Service/Volunteer - Not Medical/Clinical
Either Paid Employment - Medical/Clinical or Community Service/Volunteer - Not Medical/Clinical
